Written report is at the beginning of the notebook code. The majority of this code was based off of exercises done in class along with some help from Xpert Learning Assistant. I had to look up a few things about the isin() and IQR on Stackoverflow and in the official documentation. I've tried to keep the results as close to the example as possible and code has been commented wherever possible.
